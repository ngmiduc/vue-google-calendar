# vue-google-calendar

VueJs Week Calendar based on Google Calendar API
(to show Events from Google Calendar in a week format
and to edit and add Events to Google Calendar over API)

Uses Google data structure to render events to calendar. 
When fetching other calendar data from another calendar service
then the fetched data needs to be adapted to the google format.

Not working for the moment, still working on it.
